# Dotfiles

This is a project to automate the setup of a new linux machine, installing tools, aliases and other bash utilitaries.

This way I can also version my .bashrc related files.

It uses [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) for linking files and automating the process.

## Usage

Clone the project with
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pedrohff/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

And run the installer
```bash
sudo chmod +x ~/.dotfiles/install
~/.dotfiles/install
```
